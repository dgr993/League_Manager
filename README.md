## INSTALLATION:
"bcryptjs": "2.4.3", "config.json": "^0.0.4", "dotenv": "^8.2.0", "env": "^0.0.2", "express": "^4.17.1", "express-handlebars": "^5.1.0", "express-session": "^1.17.1", "handlebars": "^4.7.6", "handlebars.moment": "^1.0.4", "moment": "^2.27.0", "mysql2": "^2.1.0", "passport": "^0.4.1", "passport-local": "^1.0.0", "sequelize": "^6.3.4"

## USAGE:
To allow all sports, professional through amateur, to manage the leagues, players and teams

## HURDLES:
1. We experienced many git hub issues mainly with pushing to master
2. We had a hard time finding the right code to push our user input to the db
3. We could have had a better file organization as well.


## SOLUTIONS:
1. We had many discusions about proper git pushing
2. We utilized many resources from stack overlflow to in field professionals to finally arrive at a solution for pushing to db with the main fix coming from login.js
3. We deleted files that were no longer used and rearranged files to have a complete organized flow
